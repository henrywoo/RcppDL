DeepLearning in C++
============

[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/thirdwing/DeepLearning.svg?token=5n7xe4i4UCb3spCCpjsv&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/thirdwing/DeepLearning)

The code in this repo is modified from Yusuke Sugomori's [deep learning library](https://github.com/yusugomori/DeepLearning).

A bug in memory management has been fixed, and the code has been integrated with R through Rcpp.

### Methods :

  - DBN:  Deep Belief Nets

  - CDBN: Deep Belief Nets w/ continuous-valued inputs 

  - RBM:  Restricted Boltzmann Machine

  - CRBM: Restricted Boltzmann Machine w/ continuous-valued inputs

  - dA:   Denoising Autoencoders

  - SdA:  Stacked Denoising Autoencoders

  - LogisticRegression: Logistic Regression

  - HiddenLayer: Hidden Layer of Neural Networks
